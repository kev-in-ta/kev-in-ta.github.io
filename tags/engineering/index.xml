Unfortunately, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of historical record keeping over time, leaving a patchy network of details along the way. I wanted to share some of what I could find.

I was supposed to compete in 2020 as team captain of the &lt;a href="https://www.supermileage.ca/">UBC Supermileage team&lt;/a>, but lost the opportunity due to the pandemic. Now, a year after the last SAE Supermileage Competition, I wanted to dive in and share a brief and incomplete look at some of the stuff that made SAE Supermileage what it was.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
