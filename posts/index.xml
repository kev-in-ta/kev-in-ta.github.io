Now that we are solidly three decades into the world wide experiment that is the internet, it’s as good a time as any to interrogate how we get access to information, what kind of risks exist in our current media landscape, and how we can take control to critically examine the information that we consume.</description></item><item><title>Fuelathons Addendum: Research Notes</title><link>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/posts/fuelathons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/posts/fuelathons/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a brief and very incomplete history of fuelathons!
