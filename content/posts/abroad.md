## Prologue

Deciding to do a master’s is both easy and hard. There’s a familiarity in pursuing further education when you’ve done the thirteen or so years of mandatory schooling and four more years for a bachelor’s (or six like me if you took your time). It’s easy to romanticize the pursuit of knowledge. Yet, I wasn’t thrilled about forgoing income or even really prepared for the esoteric world of academia. The decision to complete a master’s is one I have plenty of strong opinions about and I’m sure I’ll share those opinions at some point. But just right now, I want to share my experience over these last two years studying abroad in Switzerland. 

## Leaving

In 2020, I was in my final year of my undergraduate degree, a Bachelor of Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I had applied and was accepted to the Master of Science in Robotics, Systems, and Control program at ETH Zurich. As a fan of science fiction, the idea of robots, of automated metal things, has been one of my primary inspirations for pursuing engineering.

Still, I wasn’t sure. The time and commitment and the distance from home were scary thoughts, doubts in need of address. How does one decide when one doesn’t know? To navigate such an incomprehensible world? Somehow, we do it all the time. This felt like one of those moments that would define before and after.

But there is one before and after in 2020 that defines such a moment for many of us. A global pandemic abruptly barred global travel, shutdown the routines to which we were accustomed, recentered our world to communicate through text and video. I wrapped up my bachelor’s virtually and the crossed the stage in imagination only. Hardly the triumphant moment I had expected. I felt my life go on pause: competitions cancelled, summer travel plans upended, a job market in uncertain hands. So what else was there to do?

It was in these conditions I left for Switzerland. While the world stood still, I stepped foot halfway across the world in a new country, at a new school, far far away from home.

To be continued...
