Now that we are solidly three decades into the world wide experiment that is the internet, it’s as good a time as any to interrogate how we get access to information, what kind of risks exist in our current media landscape, and how we can take control to critically examine the information that we consume.</description></item><item><title>UncLe-SLAM: Uncertainty Learning for Dense Neural SLAM</title><link>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/iccvw2023/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/iccvw2023/</guid><description/></item><item><title>L2E: Lasers to Events for 6-DoF Extrinsic Calibration of Lidars and Event Cameras</title><link>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/icra2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/icra2023/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fuelathons Addendum: Research Notes</title><link>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/posts/fuelathons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/posts/fuelathons/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a brief and very incomplete history of fuelathons! I wanted to make a more detailed piece about fuelathons in general as a companion post to my reflection on the SAE Supermileage competition. Unfortunately, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of historical record keeping over time, leaving a patchy network of details along the way. I wanted to share some of what I could find. (which is by no means exhaustive!</description></item><item><title>SAE Supermileage: An Enduring Technical Challenge</title><link>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/posts/sae-supermileage/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/posts/sae-supermileage/</guid><description>How far can you go on a litre of gasoline? After 43 years, the SAE Supermileage Competition came to a close in June 2022. To hear the end of a program that shaped much of my undergraduate experience left me reminiscing—of late nights hacking together prototype vehicles with fellow students all enchanted by the madness of collegiate engineering competitions. I was supposed to compete in 2020 as team captain of the UBC Supermileage team, but lost the opportunity due to the pandemic.</description></item><item><title>Studying Abroad in a Pandemic</title><link>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/posts/abroad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/posts/abroad/</guid><description>Deciding to do a master’s is both easy and hard. There’s a familiarity in pursuing further education when you’ve done the thirteen or so years of mandatory schooling and four more years for a bachelor’s (or six like me if you took your time). It’s easy to romanticize the pursuit of knowledge. On the other hand, you don&amp;rsquo;t make much (if any) money doing a master&amp;rsquo;s and many of the quirks of academia are genuinely bizarre.</description></item><item><title>ATTENTIV: Instrumented Peripheral Catheter for the Detection of Catheter Dislodgement in IV Infiltration</title><link>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/embc2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/embc2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Offline and Real-Time Implementation of a Terrain Classification Pipeline for Pushrim-Activated Power-Assisted Wheelchairs</title><link>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/embc2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/embc2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Offline and Real-Time Implementation of a Personalized Wheelchair User Intention Detection Pipeline: A Case Study</title><link>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/roman2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/roman2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Development of A Learning-Based Terrain Classification Framework for Pushrim-Activated Power-Assisted Wheelchairs</title><link>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/embc2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kev-in-ta.github.io/publications/embc2020/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
