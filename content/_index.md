Hi! I'm an incoming Software Developer at Waabi. I graduated from ETH Zurich with a M.Sc. in Robotics Systems and Control. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's at the University of British Columbia in Mechanical Engineering,  specializing in Mechatronics. 

My professional interests lie in multi-sensor systems, computer vision, and robotics. My research at the [CVL](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) focused on deep representation for multi-sensor SLAM and sensor calibration for autonomous vehicles. Previously, I worked on next-generation sensor calibration & development of self-driving cars at [Cruise](https://getcruise.com). 

During my undergraduate studies, I captained the [UBC Supemileage](https://supermileage.ca) team, an engineering design team building ultra-efficient vehicles. I am also a James Dyson National Award winner alongside my capstone team for our work on the [Attentiv Catheter](https://www.attentivmedical.com/).

I'm motivated by working at the intersection of hardware and software, for the purpose of improving our day-to-day lives. Beyond my work and research, you'll find me crushing at the bouldering gym, meeting up with my book club, or cursing at real-world RNG while playing board games.
