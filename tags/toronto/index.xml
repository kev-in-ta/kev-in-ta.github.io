The arts and culture scene in Toronto is truly spectacular and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I got to experience two films, both of which I loved. Here are my micro-reviews for them!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33022813/">IMDb&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/love_in_the_big_city_2024">Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Love in the Big City—as the move is aptly named—is a sentimental journey spanning thirteen years, following the rarely-featured platonic friendship through highly contemporary struggles. Powered by the leads&amp;rsquo; captivating chemistry, the film charms you as you’re whisked along two friends’ lives at breakneck pace. Despite the movie’s rough comedic whiplash, the story broaches its sensitive topics seriously, not shying away from its many painful and touching moments. ★★★★&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
